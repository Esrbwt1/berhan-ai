# Berhan AI (ብርሃን AI)

**Our Mission: To empower African organizations by transforming their conversations into their most valuable data asset.**

---

## About The Project

Berhan AI is building the foundational infrastructure for voice and conversation AI in Africa. Our flagship product is a state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) service specializing in Amharic and other Ethiopian languages.

The challenge is immense. Standard global ASR models fail to accurately capture the nuances of local languages, dialects, and the common practice of code-switching (mixing Amharic and English). This leaves businesses blind to the critical intelligence contained in their daily customer interactions.

**Berhan AI solves this.** We are developing a suite of AI models and developer-friendly APIs that provide an unparalleled level of accuracy and cultural context, turning the dark data of raw audio into the light of actionable insight.

## The Vision

Our vision extends beyond transcription. We are on a path to provide a full suite of conversational intelligence tools—from sentiment analysis to agent analytics—before expanding to cover every major underserved language on the continent. We are building the "Stripe for Voice AI" for Africa.

## Project Status: Day 0

This repository marks the beginning of our journey. We are currently in the foundational stage, building our initial models and engaging with our first pilot partners.

### Roadmap
- **Phase 1 (The Wedge):** `Berhan Transcribe` - A best-in-class Amharic Transcription API.
- **Phase 2 (The Platform):** `Berhan Intelligence` - A suite of analytics tools for customer intelligence.
- **Phase 3 (The Ecosystem):** `Berhan Atlas` - A pan-African API for all major African languages.

## Get Involved

We are actively seeking pilot partners in the telecommunications, banking, and customer service sectors in Ethiopia. If you are interested in gaining a competitive edge by unlocking the insights in your audio data, please reach out.
